  This paper describes a parallel strategy to extend the scalability
  of a small 3D FFT on thousands of Blue Gene/L processors.
  The approach is to execute the intermediate phases of the 3D FFT on
  smaller processor subsets.  Performance
  measurements of the standalone 3D FFT on two communication
  protocols, MPI and BG/L ADE \cite{giampapa:2005} are presented.
  While the performance of the 3D-FFT with MPI-based and BG/L ADE-based implementations
  exhibited qualitatively similar behavior, the BG/L ADE-based version
  has lower communication cost than the MPI based version for small message sizes.
  Measurements also show that the proposed approach is effective
  in improving Particle-Mesh-based N-body simulation performance
  significantly at the limits of scalability.
