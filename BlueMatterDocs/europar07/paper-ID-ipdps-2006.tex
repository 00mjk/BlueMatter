\Section{Introduction}

Please follow the steps outlined below when submitting your
manuscript to the IEEE International Parallel and Distributed
Processing Symposium. Note there have been some changes to the
measurements from previous instructions. Your goal is to simulate
the usual appearance of papers in an IEEE conference proceedings.
For items not addressed in these instructions, please contact the
Proceedings Chair at ipdps@umr.edu.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

\Section{Margins and page numbering}

Prepare your paper in full-size format, on US letter paper (8.5 by
11 inches).

\emph{Margins}: top = 1 inch, bottom = 1.125 inch, side = 0.8125
inches.

\emph{Page numbering}: Do \textbf{not} number your pages. The page
numbering will be done by the publisher.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\Section{Fonts}

Times New Roman is the preferred font. Times or Times Roman may also
be used. All manuscripts must be in English.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\Section{Formatting your paper}

The total allowable width of the text area is 6.875 inches (17.5 cm)
wide by 8.875 inches (22.54 cm) high. The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are
to be in a two-column format.  Columns are to be 3.25 inches (8.25
cm) wide, with a 0.3125 inch (0.8 cm) space between them.

%8.5 - 6.875 = 1.625
%
%1.625/2 = 0.8125

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\Section{Main Title}

Center the title 1.375 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of the
first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives,
and adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two
blank lines after the title.

\Section{Author names and Affiliations} Author names and
affiliations are to be centered beneath the title and printed in
Times 12-point, non-boldface type. Please see the affiliations given
under the title of this paper as an example. Include e-mail
addresses if possible. Follow the author information by two blank
lines before main text.

\Section{Second and Following Pages}

The second and following pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from
the top edge. On all pages, the bottom margin should be 1.125 inches
(2.86 cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch
paper.


\Section{Main Text}

Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx.
1/6 inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that
is, flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional
blank lines between paragraphs. Figure and table captions should be
10-point Helvetica boldface type as in
\begin{figure}[h]
   \caption{Example of caption.}
\end{figure}

\noindent Long captions should be set as in
\begin{figure}[h]
   \caption{Example of long caption requiring more than one line. It is
     not typed centered but aligned on both sides and indented with an
     additional margin on both sides of 1~pica.}
\end{figure}

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-,
second-, and third-order headings.

\Section{First-Order Headings} \label{foh}

First-order headings (for example, Section \ref{foh} heading in this
document) should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized,
flush left, with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

\SubSection{Second-Order Headings} \label{soh}

Second-order headings (for example, Subsection \ref{soh} heading)
should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush
left, with one blank line before, and one after.\\~\\
\textbf{Third-Order Headings.} If you require a third-order heading
(we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially
capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a
period and your text on the same line.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\SubSection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes sparingly%
\footnote
   {%
     Or, better still, try to avoid footnotes altogether.  To help your
     readers, avoid using footnotes altogether and include necessary
     peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if you
     prefer, as in this sentence).
   }
and place them at the bottom of the column on the page on which they are
referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\SubSection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the
text, enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{KwA98,NoS91,TkB99}. Where appropriate, include the
name(s) of editors of referenced books.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\SubSection{Figures and Tables}

Position figures and tables at the tops and bottoms of columns.
Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and
tables may span across both columns. Avoid placing figures and
tables before their first mention in the text.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\SubSection{Copyright forms}

You must include your fully-completed, signed IEEE copyright release
form when you submit your paper. We must have this form before your
paper can be published in the proceedings. The copyright form is
available from the IPDPS web site as a fillable PDF form.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ipdps@umr.edu or phone (573) 341-4511.
