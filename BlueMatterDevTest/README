This directory tree can run several md runs using Blue Matter and checks the
results against selfcontianed regression data.

The scripts check against save baseline regression data and also the last
of a succession of runs.  For successive runs, the check (rdgdiff) must
see the md results as identical -- binary regression.  If a run fails to be within
tolerance of the baseline or identical to your last run, and email will be sent yo
your user id formed as <gsaid>@us.ibm.com

To run this, you must either be in a ode sandbox or have the SANDBOX env variable
set to identify a sandbox to test.

To use this, the whole directory tree must be in a filesystem that can run on BGW.
You may need to copy this directory to another location eg /bgwhome1/...

Keep in mind that no old results are automatically deleted so you need to clean up
now and then.
