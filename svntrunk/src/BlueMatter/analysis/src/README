This directory contains two utilities:  MDLogger and rdgdiff

MDLogger RawDatagramOutputFile <WindowWidth>
will output energy information per time step contained in the file specified.
The file will be "tail'd" by MDLogger, so that it will work with a file that is growing
during a simulation.  The termination criterion is the "The End" packet output by the simulation.

If the second parameter, WindowWidth is included, the output will occur every WindowWidth time step,
and basic energy statistics will be output in a format similar to Bob's perl script.
The final line gives statistics over the entire run.
N.B.  Entering a window width longer than the run will output only the statistics for the whole run.

To do:
1)  Handle time out condition in case the file doesn't contain the "End" packet
2)  Handle NAN output caused by underflow with the output values are constant.
3)  Provide other types of statistics, as needed.




rdgdiff RDGFile1 RDGFile2
will compare the two raw datagram files and return 0 if they are identical, 1 if the differ.
Note that the comparison is based on a time step by time step comparison of the site variables
and energies, so two files may be different on a binary level but identical on the basis
of actual simulation results.  As with MDLogger, the two files must contain the "End" packet.

rdgdiff will also print a simple message to stdout, but regression scripts should check the
integer value returned by the call.

To do:
1)  Allow specified tolerance in energy, position, and velocity (others?)
2)  Check that the two files specified are valid files
3)  Allow time out condition so that the "End" is not needed
