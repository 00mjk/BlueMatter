To use the tracer tools

If pktrace output is in many files, you must merge to a single file.

When pk trace output is in a single file, probably a .stdout file:
1) rename the .stdout file to something you like,
mv wR431-17326.stdout MyCoolRun.stdout

2) run the proc256trc script on your stdout file (can take a while to run)
proc256trc MyCoolRun.stdout

3) you will have a MyCoolRun.stdout.trc file.  start the trace tool:
./tracer &

4) On the tracer tool GUI, click the "Create Trace View" button, and get the "Load Group" popup

5) In the "Trace Data File" field of the popup, selcet your trace file
MyCoolRun.stdout.trc


6) In the "Regular Expression File" field of the popup, selcet your trace tool profile
TV_Sample20Percent

7) Click OK on the lower left of the popup
OK

8) wait until trace tool has loaded trace file and plotted (can be a while, esp on a slow network)
You will probably see some initial traces on the black area and the grey bars in the
left margine will turn into a little for each trace line on the screen.

9) using the "Scale Selection" buttons at the bottom of the trace GUI, select larger time scales
until the traces for the run are painted on the screen.  The setup period will probably look like
a smudge of traces followed by a blank area, followed by a colored bar of trace date.  Move the
mouse onto the right end colored area and press the middle button to center.

10) Zoom back in gradually using the Scale Selection buttons.  Every one or two orders of magnitude
during zoom in, you may need to recenter the view using your mouse middle button.

11) Use the "Zoom" arrows to the left of the "Scale Selection" buttons to fine tune the timescale
displayed.

12) To measure a time interval, make sure the whole interval is displayed on the screen.
Use the right mouse button by depressing at the start, holding while moving mouse to end of interval,
and reading time at top of screen.
