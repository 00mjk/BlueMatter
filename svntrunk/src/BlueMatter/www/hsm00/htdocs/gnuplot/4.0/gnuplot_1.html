<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC3">1.2 Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>


<P>
`gnuplot` is a command-driven interactive function and data plotting program.
It is case sensitive (commands and function names written in lowercase are
not the same as those written in CAPS).  All command names may be abbreviated
as long as the abbreviation is not ambiguous.  Any number of commands may
appear on a line (with the exception that `load` or section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC93">2.2 call</A> must be the final
command), separated by semicolons (;).  Strings are indicated with quotes.
They may be either single or double quotation marks, e.g.,



<PRE>
      load "filename"
      cd 'dir'

</PRE>

<P>
although there are some subtle differences (see `syntax` for more details).


<P>
Any command-line arguments are assumed to be names of files containing
`gnuplot` commands, with the exception of standard X11 arguments, which are
processed first.  Each file is loaded with the `load` command, in the order
specified.  `gnuplot` exits after the last file is processed.  When no load
files are named, `gnuplot` enters into an interactive mode.  The special
filename "-" is used to denote standard input.  See "help batch/interactive"
for more details.


<P>
Many `gnuplot` commands have multiple options.  These options must appear in
the proper order, although unwanted ones may be omitted in most cases.  Thus
if the entire command is "command a b c", then "command a c" will probably
work, but "command c a" will fail.


<P>
Commands may extend over several input lines by ending each line but the last
with a backslash (\).  The backslash must be the _last_ character on each
line.  The effect is as if the backslash and newline were not there.  That
is, no white space is implied, nor is a comment terminated.  Therefore,
commenting out a continued line comments out the entire command
(see `comments`).  But note that if an error occurs somewhere on a multi-line
command, the parser may not be able to locate precisely where the error is
and in that case will not necessarily point to the correct line.


<P>
In this document, curly braces ({}) denote optional arguments and a vertical
bar (|) separates mutually exclusive choices.  `gnuplot` keywords or section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC108">2.6 help</A>
topics are indicated by backquotes or `boldface` (where available).  Angle
brackets (&#60;&#62;) are used to mark replaceable tokens.  In many cases, a default
value of the token will be taken for optional arguments if the token is
omitted, but these cases are not always denoted with braces around the angle
brackets.


<P>
For on-line help on any topic, type section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC108">2.6 help</A> followed by the name of the topic
or just section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC108">2.6 help</A> or `?` to get a menu of available topics.


<P>
The new `gnuplot` user should begin by reading about `plotting` (if on-line,
type `help plotting`).

<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC5">1.4 What is New in Version 4.0</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>


<P>
The previous official release of gnuplot was version 3.7, with subversions up
to 3.7.3. Gnuplot version 4.0 contains many new features, which were gradually
introduced into a series of development snapshots 3.8a through 3.8k. This
section lists major additions and gives a partial list of changes and minor
new features. Sample gnuplot scripts demonstrating many of these features are
provided in the gnuplot distribution, and are referred to here by name.

<H3><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC6">1.4.1 Mouse and hotkey support in interactive terminals</A></H3>

<P>
Interaction with the current plot via mouse and hotkeys is supported for the
X11, OS/2 Presentation Manager, ggi and Windows terminals. See `mouse input`
for more information on mousing. See help for section <A HREF="gnuplot_1.html#SEC84">1.12.1 bind</A> for information on
hotkeys. Also see the documentation for individual mousing terminals `ggi`,
`pm`, `windows` and `x11`.


<P>
Here are briefly some useful hotkeys.
Hit 'h' in the interactive interval for help. Hit 'm' to switch mousing on/off.
Hit 'g' for grid, 'l' for log and 'e' for replot.
Hit 'r' for ruler to measure peak distances (linear scale) or peak ratios (log
scale), and '5' for polar coordinates inside a map.
Zoom by mouse (MB3), and move in the zoom history by 'p', 'u', 'n'; hit 'a' for
autoscale.
Use other mouse buttons to put current mouse coordinates to clipboard (double
click of MB1), add temporarily or permanently labels to the plot (middle mouse
button MB2).
Rotate a 3D surface by mouse. 
Hit spacebar to switch to the gnuplot command window.


<P>
Sample script: mousevariables.dem




<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC7">1.4.2 New terminal features</A></H3>

<P>
`aqua`: New terminal for Mac OS X. Requires AquaTerm 1.0 or later.


<P>
`epslatex`: New terminal. Prepares eps figures for inclusion in LaTeX
documents.


<P>
`gif`: Support for this terminal has been dropped in favour of the `png`
format for legal reasons; under usual configure conditions, old scripts that
request gif will work but will produce a `png` file instead.


<P>
`ggi`: New full-screen interactive terminal for Linux. Interface to the
General Graphics Interface Library.


<P>
`pdf`: New terminal exporting Adobe Portable Document Format. Requires libpdf.


<P>
`png` and `jpeg`: Support for both PNG and JPEG image output is provided by a
new driver via libgd. The new driver supports many more features than the
old png driver, including TrueType fonts. Requires libgd.


<P>
section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC198">2.19.49.6 postscript</A>: The PostScript driver now provides an oblique symbol font, and
allows run-time inclusion of embedded PostScript fonts. It also supports
additional character encodings. See `postscript fontfile` and section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC158">2.19.18 encoding</A>.


<P>
Sample script: fontfile.dem


<P>
`svg`: New terminal exporting Scalable Vector Graphics.


<P>
`x11`: The X-windows driver now allows you to specify fonts, see
`set term x11 x11_fonts`. There is no longer a limit to the number of x11 plot
windows opened simultaneously, and each plot window can be given its own
title. See `set term x11`.




<H3><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC8">1.4.3 New plot style section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC191">2.19.48 pm3d</A></A></H3>

<P>
The `splot` command is now capable of plotting 2D maps and 3D surfaces 
colored by greyscale or color palettes. See help for section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC191">2.19.48 pm3d</A>, section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC192">2.19.49 palette</A>, 
section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC352">2.19.113 cbrange</A>, `set view map`, `set colorbox` and section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC192">2.19.49 palette</A>.


<P>
Sample scripts: pm3d.dem pm3dcolors.dem pm3dgamma.dem




<H3><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC9">1.4.4 New plot style `filledcurves`</A></H3>

<P>
The style `filledcurves` allows to fill an area between the drawn curve and a
horizontal line.


<P>
Sample script: fillcrvs.dem




<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC10">1.4.5 Filled boxes</A></H3>

<P>
A solid color or patterned fill style can be set for any plot style that 
contains boxes. See `boxes`, `boxerrorbars`, `boxxyerrorbars`,
`candlesticks`, `set style fill`.


<P>
Sample scripts: fillstyle.dem candlesticks.dem




<H3><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC11">1.4.6 New plot option smooth frequency</A></H3>

<P>
Input data can be filtered through several built-in routines for interpolation
or approximation of data.  See section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC118">2.11.1.4 smooth</A>, `frequency`, `unique`.


<P>
Sample scripts: step.dem mgr.dem




<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC12">1.4.7 Improved text options</A></H3>

<P>
Most gnuplot plot commands that produce text labels now accept modifiers to 
specify text color, font, size, and rotation angle. See section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC171">2.19.29 label</A>.
Not all terminal types support these options, however.  The enhanced text
mode previously available for the postscript and pm terminals has been
extended to other terminal types as well.  Terminal types currently supported
include dumb, jpeg, pdf, pm, png, postscript, and x11. See `enhanced text`.


<P>
Sample scripts: textcolor.dem textrotate.dem




<H3><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC13">1.4.8 More text encodings</A></H3>

<P>
Several terminals, including section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC198">2.19.49.6 postscript</A>, `x11` and `pm`, support additional
text `encodings`: ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1), ISO 8859-2 (Latin 2), ISO 8859-15 
(variant of 8859-1 with Euro sign), KOI8-R (cyrillic), and miscellaneous
codepages. See section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC158">2.19.18 encoding</A> for more details.




<H3><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC14">1.4.9 Arrows</A></H3>

<P>
Single- or double-ended arrows can be placed on a plot individually from the
command line or from a data file via the `plot with vectors` style.
See section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC137">2.19.2 arrow</A>, `plotting styles vectors`.


<P>
Sample script: arrowstyle.dem




<H3><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC15">1.4.10 Data file format</A></H3>

<P>
The new `set datafile` command can be used to specify information about the
format of input data files, including the characters used to separate fields, 
to indicate comment lines, and to specify missing data.  Gnuplot now attempts 
to recognize text fields with embedded blanks as single entities based on the 
datafile format settings.  This allows input from csv (comma-separated value)
files such as those exported by spreadsheet programs. See `set datafile`.




<H3><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC16">1.4.11 Other changes and additions</A></H3>

<P>
The preferred syntax to undo a command `set &#60;something&#62;` is now 
`unset &#60;something&#62;` rather than `set no&#60;something&#62;`. The older form has been
deprecated.  Version 4.0 continues to allow the older syntax, but such 
backwards compatibility may be lost in future versions.


<P>
Commands of the form `set &#60;something&#62; &#60;style&#62;` also are deprectated in favor
of the more general form `set style &#60;something&#62; &#60;options&#62;`.  Many more plot
elements now have style options of their own, including arrows, filled
areas, lines, and points. There are also style settings for input data and
formatting. Please see section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC206">2.19.57 style</A>, section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC155">2.19.15 decimalsign</A>, and `set datafile`.


<P>
Improved 2D and 3D clipping (hidden lines).


<P>
More consistent point styles and other default formatting styles across
all terminals. Please use the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC363">2.23 test</A> command to check default styles and
plotting capabilities for the currently selected terminal type.


<P>
The section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC171">2.19.29 label</A> command supports associated points, and allows you to 
specify point style and text style (font, rotation, etc). User variables
can be included in labels via format specifiers in the label text.
See section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC171">2.19.29 label</A>.


<P>
New command `set view map` to select top-view 2D projection of 3D surface plot.


<P>
New commands `set term push` and `set term pop` to achieve platform
independent restoring of the terminal after printing,


<P>
The `load` and section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC134">2.18 save</A> commands accept piped input and output, respectively.


<P>
The `history` command (for gnuplot with its own readline, not with GNU
readline) now includes several useful options.


<P>
The built-in function `rand(x)` has been modified to allow explicit seeding
of the pseudo-random number generator. See `random`.


<P>
The MS Windows package includes an additional executable `pgnuplot.exe` to
support piping command through standard input, which is otherwise not
available for graphical applications on this system.




<H3><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC17">1.4.12 Accompanying documentation</A></H3>

<P>
In directory docs/psdocs/ you may find new information in the gnuplot output
postscript file guide, list of postscript symbols in different encodings.


<P>
Improved FAQ. Please read it before asking your question in a public forum.


<P>
There are plenty of new demos *.dem in the demo/ directory. Please run them,
for example by

<PRE>
      load "all.dem"
</PRE>

<P>
before asking for help.  Plots produced by the demo scripts can also be viewed

<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC18">1.5 Batch/Interactive Operation</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>


<P>
`gnuplot` may be executed in either batch or interactive modes, and the two
may even be mixed together on many systems.


<P>
Any command-line arguments are assumed to be names of files containing
`gnuplot` commands (with the exception of standard X11 arguments, which are
processed first).  Each file is loaded with the `load` command, in the order
specified.  `gnuplot` exits after the last file is processed.  When no load
files are named, `gnuplot` enters into an interactive mode.  The special
filename "-" is used to denote standard input.


<P>
Both the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC95">2.4 exit</A> and section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC130">2.14 quit</A> commands terminate the current command file and
`load` the next one, until all have been processed.


<P>
Examples:


<P>
To launch an interactive session:

<PRE>
      gnuplot

</PRE>

<P>
To launch a batch session using two command files "input1" and "input2":

<PRE>
      gnuplot input1 input2

</PRE>

<P>
To launch an interactive session after an initialization file "header" and
followed by another command file "trailer":

<PRE>
      gnuplot header - trailer

</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC19">1.6 Command-line-editing</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>


<P>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>


<P>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>


<P>
Command-line editing is supported by the Unix, Atari, VMS, MS-DOS and OS/2
versions of `gnuplot`.  Also, a history mechanism allows previous commands to
be edited and re-executed.  After the command line has been edited, a newline
or carriage return will enter the entire line without regard to where the
cursor is positioned.


<P>
(The readline function in `gnuplot` is not the same as the readline used in
GNU Bash and GNU Emacs.  If the GNU version is desired, it may be selected
instead of the `gnuplot` version at compile time.)


<P>
The editing commands are as follows:



<PRE>
      `Line-editing`:

</PRE>


<PRE>
      ^B    moves back a single character.
      ^F    moves forward a single character.
      ^A    moves to the beginning of the line.
      ^E    moves to the end of the line.
      ^H    and DEL delete the previous character.
      ^D    deletes the current character.
      ^K    deletes from current position to the end of line.
      ^L,^R redraws line in case it gets trashed.
      ^U    deletes the entire line.
      ^W    deletes from the current word to the end of line.

</PRE>


<PRE>
      `History`:

</PRE>


<PRE>
      ^P    moves back through history.
      ^N    moves forward through history.

</PRE>

<P>
On the IBM PC, the use of a TSR program such as DOSEDIT or CED may be desired
for line editing.  The default makefile assumes that this is the case;  by
default `gnuplot` will be compiled with no line-editing capability.  If you
want to use `gnuplot`'s line editing, set READLINE in the makefile and add
readline.obj to the link file.  The following arrow keys may be used on the
IBM PC and Atari versions if readline is used:



<PRE>
      Left  Arrow      - same as ^B.
      Right Arrow      - same as ^F.
      Ctrl Left  Arrow - same as ^A.
      Ctrl Right Arrow - same as ^E.
      Up    Arrow      - same as ^P.
      Down  Arrow      - same as ^N.

</PRE>

<P>
The Atari version of readline defines some additional key aliases:



<PRE>
      Undo            - same as ^L.
      Home            - same as ^A.
      Ctrl Home       - same as ^E.
      Esc             - same as ^U.
      Help            - section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC108">2.6 help</A> plus return.
      Ctrl Help       - `help `.

</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC20">1.7 Comments</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>


<P>
Comments are supported as follows: a `#` may appear in most places in a line
and `gnuplot` will ignore the rest of the line.  It will not have this effect
inside quotes, inside numbers (including complex numbers), inside command
substitutions, etc.  In short, it works anywhere it makes sense to work.


<P>
See also `set datafile commentschars` for specifying comment characters in
data files.

The commands section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC137">2.19.2 arrow</A>, section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC170">2.19.28 key</A>, and section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC171">2.19.29 label</A> allow you to draw
something at an arbitrary position on the graph.  This position is specified
by the syntax:



<PRE>
      {&#60;system&#62;} &#60;x&#62;, {&#60;system&#62;} &#60;y&#62; {,{&#60;system&#62;} &#60;z&#62;}

</PRE>

<P>
Each &#60;system&#62; can either be `first`, `second`, `graph` or `screen`.


<P>
`first` places the x, y, or z coordinate in the system defined by the left
and bottom axes; `second` places it in the system defined by the second axes
(top and right); `graph` specifies the area within the axes--0,0 is bottom
left and 1,1 is top right (for splot, 0,0,0 is bottom left of plotting area;
use negative z to get to the base--see section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC300">2.19.61 ticslevel</A>); and `screen`
specifies the screen area (the entire area--not just the portion selected by
section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC205">2.19.56 size</A>), with 0,0 at bottom left and 1,1 at top right.


<P>
If the coordinate system for x is not specified, `first` is used.  If the
system for y is not specified, the one used for x is adopted.


<P>
If one (or more) axis is timeseries, the appropriate coordinate should
be given as a quoted time string according to the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC303">2.19.64 timefmt</A> format string.
See section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC319">2.19.80 xdata</A> and section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC303">2.19.64 timefmt</A>.  `gnuplot` will also accept an integer
expression, which will be interpreted as seconds from 1 January 2000.




<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC22">1.9 Environment</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>


<P>
A number of shell environment variables are understood by `gnuplot`.  None of
these are required, but may be useful.


<P>
If GNUTERM is defined, it is used as the name of the terminal type to be
used.  This overrides any terminal type sensed by `gnuplot` on start-up, but
is itself overridden by the .gnuplot (or equivalent) start-up file
(see `start-up`) and, of course, by later explicit changes.


<P>
On Unix, AmigaOS, AtariTOS, MS-DOS and OS/2, GNUHELP may be defined to be the
pathname of the HELP file (gnuplot.gih).


<P>
On VMS, the logical name GNUPLOT$HELP should be defined as the name of the
help library for `gnuplot`.  The `gnuplot` help can be put inside any system
help library, allowing access to help from both within and outside `gnuplot`
if desired.


<P>
On Unix, HOME is used as the name of a directory to search for a .gnuplot
file if none is found in the current directory.  On AmigaOS, AtariTOS,
MS-DOS, Windows and OS/2, GNUPLOT is used.  On Windows, the NT-specific
variable USERPROFILE is tried, too. VMS, SYS$LOGIN: is used. Type `help
start-up`.


<P>
On Unix, PAGER is used as an output filter for help messages.


<P>
On Unix, AtariTOS and AmigaOS, SHELL is used for the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC354">2.20 shell</A> command.  On
MS-DOS and OS/2, COMSPEC is used for the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC354">2.20 shell</A> command.


<P>
On MS-DOS, if the BGI or Watcom interface is used, PCTRM is used to tell
the maximum resolution supported by your monitor by setting it to
S&#60;max. horizontal resolution&#62;. E.g. if your monitor's maximum resolution is
800x600, then use:

<PRE>
      set PCTRM=S800
</PRE>

<P>
If PCTRM is not set, standard VGA is used.


<P>
FIT_SCRIPT may be used to specify a `gnuplot` command to be executed when a
fit is interrupted--see `fit`.  FIT_LOG specifies the default filename of the
logfile maintained by fit.


<P>
GNUPLOT_LIB may be used to define additional search directories for data
and command files. The variable may contain a single directory name, or
a list of directories separated by a platform-specific path separator,
eg. ':' on Unix, or ';' on DOS/Windows/OS/2/Amiga platforms. The contents
of GNUPLOT_LIB are appended to the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC173">2.19.31 loadpath</A> variable, but not saved
with the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC134">2.18 save</A> and `save set` commands.


<P>
Several gnuplot terminal drivers access TrueType fonts via the gd library.
For these drivers the font search path is controlled by the environmental
variable GDFONTPATH.  Furthermore, a default font for these drivers may be
set via the environmental variable GNUPLOT_DEFAULT_GDFONT.


<P>
The postscript terminal uses its own font search path. It is controlled by
the environmental variable GNUPLOT_FONTPATH. The format is the same as for
GNUPLOT_LIB. The contents of GNUPLOT_FONTPATH are appended to the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC160">2.19.20 fontpath</A>
variable, but not saved with the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC134">2.18 save</A> and `save set` commands.




<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC23">1.10 Expressions</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>


<P>
In general, any mathematical expression accepted by C, FORTRAN, Pascal, or
BASIC is valid.  The precedence of these operators is determined by the
specifications of the C programming language.  White space (spaces and tabs)
is ignored inside expressions.


<P>
Complex constants are expressed as {&#60;real&#62;,&#60;imag&#62;}, where &#60;real&#62; and &#60;imag&#62;
must be numerical constants.  For example, {3,2} represents 3 + 2i; {0,1}
represents 'i' itself.  The curly braces are explicitly required here.


<P>
Note that gnuplot uses both "real" and "integer" arithmetic, like FORTRAN and
C.  Integers are entered as "1", "-10", etc; reals as "1.0", "-10.0", "1e1",
3.5e-1, etc.  The most important difference between the two forms is in
division: division of integers truncates: 5/2 = 2; division of reals does
not: 5.0/2.0 = 2.5.  In mixed expressions, integers are "promoted" to reals
before evaluation: 5/2e0 = 2.5.  The result of division of a negative integer
by a positive one may vary among compilers.  Try a test like "print -5/2" to
determine if your system chooses -2 or -3 as the answer.


<P>
The integer expression "1/0" may be used to generate an "undefined" flag,
which causes a point to ignored; the `ternary` operator gives an example.


<P>
The real and imaginary parts of complex expressions are always real, whatever
the form in which they are entered: in {3,2} the "3" and "2" are reals, not
integers.

The functions in `gnuplot` are the same as the corresponding functions in
the Unix math library, except that all functions accept integer, real, and
complex arguments, unless otherwise noted.


<P>
For those functions that accept or return angles that may be given in either
degrees or radians (sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), asin(x), acos(x), atan(x),
atan2(x) and arg(z)), the unit may be selected by section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC136">2.19.1 angles</A>, which

<P>
(*) Starred explanations indicate that the operator requires an integer
argument.


<P>
Operator precedence is the same as in Fortran and C.  As in those languages,
parentheses may be used to change the order of operation.  Thus -2**2 = -4,
but (-2)**2 = 4.


<P>
The factorial operator returns a real number to allow a greater range.




<H4><A NAME="SEC79" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC79">1.10.2.2 Binary</A></H4>

<P>
Logical AND (&#38;&#38;) and OR (||) short-circuit the way they do in C.  That is,
the second `&#38;&#38;` operand is not evaluated if the first is false; the second
`||` operand is not evaluated if the first is true.




<H4><A NAME="SEC80" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC80">1.10.2.3 Ternary</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX112"></A>


<P>
There is a single ternary operator:



<PRE>
    Symbol       Example      Explanation
      ?:          a?b:c     ternary operation

</PRE>

<P>
The ternary operator behaves as it does in C.  The first argument (a), which
must be an integer, is evaluated.  If it is true (non-zero), the second
argument (b) is evaluated and returned; otherwise the third argument (c) is
evaluated and returned.


<P>
The ternary operator is very useful both in constructing piecewise functions
and in plotting points only when certain conditions are met.


<P>
Examples:


<P>
Plot a function that is to equal sin(x) for 0 &#60;= x &#60; 1, 1/x for 1 &#60;= x &#60; 2,
and undefined elsewhere:

<PRE>
      f(x) = 0&#60;=x &#38;&#38; x&#60;1 ? sin(x) : 1&#60;=x &#38;&#38; x&#60;2 ? 1/x : 1/0
      plot f(x)
</PRE>

<P>
Note that `gnuplot` quietly ignores undefined values, so the final branch of
the function (1/0) will produce no plottable points.  Note also that f(x)
will be plotted as a continuous function across the discontinuity if a line
style is used.  To plot it discontinuously, create separate functions for the
two pieces.  (Parametric functions are also useful for this purpose.)


<P>
For data in a file, plot the average of the data in columns 2 and 3 against
the datum in column 1, but only if the datum in column 4 is non-negative:



<PRE>
      plot 'file' using 1:( $4&#60;0 ? 1/0 : ($2+$3)/2 )

</PRE>

<P>
Please see section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC121">2.11.1.7 using</A> for an explanation of the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC121">2.11.1.7 using</A> syntax.

      plot f(x) = sin(x*a), a = 0.2, f(x), a = 0.4, f(x)

</PRE>

<P>
Note that the variable `pi` is already defined.  But it is in no way magic;
you may redefine it to be whatever you like.


<P>
Valid names are the same as in most programming languages: they must begin
with a letter, but subsequent characters may be letters, digits, "$", or "_".
Note, however, that the `fit` mechanism uses several variables with names
that begin "FIT_".  It is safest to avoid using such names.  "FIT_LIMIT",
however, is one that you may wish to redefine. See the documentation
on `fit` for details.

<H2><A NAME="SEC82" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC82">1.11 Glossary</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>


<P>
Throughout this document an attempt has been made to maintain consistency of
nomenclature.  This cannot be wholly successful because as `gnuplot` has
evolved over time, certain command and keyword names have been adopted that
preclude such perfection.  This section contains explanations of the way
some of these terms are used.


<P>
A "page" or "screen" is the entire area addressable by `gnuplot`.  On a
monitor, it is the full screen; on a plotter, it is a single sheet of paper.


<P>
A screen may contain one or more "plots".  A plot is defined by an abscissa
and an ordinate, although these need not actually appear on it, as well as
the margins and any text written therein.


<P>
A plot contains one "graph".  A graph is defined by an abscissa and an
ordinate, although these need not actually appear on it.


<P>
A graph may contain one or more "lines".  A line is a single function or
data set.  "Line" is also a plotting style.  The word will also be used in
sense "a line of text".  Presumably the context will remove any ambiguity.


<P>
The lines on a graph may have individual names.  These may be listed
together with a sample of the plotting style used to represent them in
the "key", sometimes also called the "legend".


<P>
The word "title" occurs with multiple meanings in `gnuplot`.  In this
document, it will always be preceded by the adjective "plot", "line", or
"key" to differentiate among them.


<P>
A 2-d graph may have up to four labelled axes.  The names of the four axes
for these usages are "x" for the axis along the bottom border of the plot,
"y" for the left border, "x2" for the top border, and "y2" for the right
border.


<P>
A 3-d graph may have up to three labelled axes -- "x", "y" and "z".  It is
not possible to say where on the graph any particular axis will fall because
you can change the direction from which the graph is seen with section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC310">2.19.71 view</A>.


<P>
When discussing data files, the term "record" will be resurrected and used
to denote a single line of text in the file, that is, the characters between
newline or end-of-record characters.  A "point" is the datum extracted from
a single record.  A "datablock" is a set of points from consecutive records,
delimited by blank records.  A line, when referred to in the context of a
data file, is a subset of a datablock.




<H2><A NAME="SEC83" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC83">1.12 mouse input</A></H2>

<P>
The `x11`, `pm`, `windows`, and `ggi` terminals allow interaction with the

to activate pre-defined functions by hitting a single key while the mouse

input with `batch` command scripts, by invoking the command `pause mouse`
and then using the mouse variables returned by mouse clicking as parameters

The section <A HREF="gnuplot_1.html#SEC84">1.12.1 bind</A> allows defining or redefining a hotkey, i.e. a sequence of gnuplot

<H3><A NAME="SEC85" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC85">1.12.2 mouse_variables</A></H3>

<P>
When mousing is active, clicking in the active window will set several user
variables that can be accessed from the gnuplot command line. The coordinates
of the mouse at the time of the click are stored in MOUSE_X MOUSE_Y MOUSE_X2
and MOUSE_Y2. The mouse button clicked, and any meta-keys active at that time,
are stored in MOUSE_BUTTON MOUSE_SHIFT MOUSE_ALT and MOUSE_CTRL.  These 
variables are set to undefined at the start of every plot, and only become 
defined in the event of a mouse click in the active plot window. To determine
from a script if the mouse has been clicked in the active plot window, it is
sufficient to test for any one of these variables being defined.

<A NAME="IDX118"></A>


<P>
There are three `gnuplot` commands which actually create a plot: `plot`,
`splot` and section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC131">2.15 replot</A>.  `plot` generates 2-d plots, `splot` generates 3-d
plots (actually 2-d projections, of course), and section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC131">2.15 replot</A> appends its
arguments to the previous `plot` or `splot` and executes the modified
command.


<P>
Much of the general information about plotting can be found in the discussion
of `plot`; information specific to 3-d can be found in the `splot` section.


<P>
`plot` operates in either rectangular or polar coordinates -- see `set polar`
for details of the latter.  `splot` operates only in rectangular coordinates,
but the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC176">2.19.34 mapping</A> command allows for a few other coordinate systems to be
treated.  In addition, the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC121">2.11.1.7 using</A> option allows both `plot` and `splot` to
treat almost any coordinate system you'd care to define.


<P>
`plot` also lets you use each of the four borders -- x (bottom), x2 (top), y
(left) and y2 (right) -- as an independent axis.  The `axes` option lets you
choose which pair of axes a given function or data set is plotted against.  A
full complement of `set` commands exists to give you complete control over
the scales and labelling of each axis.  Some commands have the name of an
axis built into their names, such as section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC321">2.19.82 xlabel</A>.  Other commands have one
or more axis names as options, such as `set logscale xy`.  Commands and
options controlling the z axis have no effect on 2-d graphs.


<P>
`splot` can plot surfaces and contours in addition to points and/or lines.
In addition to `splot`, see section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC169">2.19.27 isosamples</A> for information about defining
the grid for a 3-d function;  `splot datafile` for information about the
requisite file structure for 3-d data values; and section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC149">2.19.12 contour</A> and
section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC147">2.19.10 cntrparam</A> for information about contours.


<P>
In `splot`, control over the scales and labels of the axes are the same as
with `plot`, except that commands and options controlling the x2 and y2 axes
have no effect whereas of course those controlling the z axis do take effect.


<P>
`splot` allows plotting of binary and matrix data, but only for specific
data formats.  See `splot` for details.

When `gnuplot` is run, it looks for an initialization file to load.
This file is called `.gnuplot` on Unix and AmigaOS systems, and
`GNUPLOT.INI` on other systems.  If this file is not found in the
current directory, the program will look for it in the HOME directory
(under AmigaOS, Atari(single)TOS, MS-DOS, Windows and OS/2, the
environment variable `GNUPLOT` should contain the name of this
directory; on Windows NT, it will use `USERPROFILE` if GNUPLOT isn't
defined).  Note: if NOCWDRC is defined during the installation,
`gnuplot` will not read from the current directory.


<P>
If the initialization file is found, `gnuplot` executes the commands in it.
These may be any legal `gnuplot` commands, but typically they are limited to
setting the terminal and defining frequently-used functions or variables.




<H2><A NAME="SEC88" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC88">1.15 Substitution</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>


<P>
Command-line substitution is specified by a system command enclosed in
backquotes.  This command is spawned and the output it produces replaces
the name of the command (and backquotes) on the command line.  Some
implementations also support pipes;  see section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC119">2.11.1.5 special-filenames</A>.


<P>
Command-line substitution can be used anywhere on the `gnuplot` command
line, except inside strings delimited by single quotes.


<P>
Example:


<P>
This will run the program `leastsq` and replace `leastsq` (including
backquotes) on the command line with its output:

<PRE>
      f(x) = `leastsq`

</PRE>

<P>
or, in VMS

<PRE>
      f(x) = `run leastsq`

</PRE>

<P>
These will generate labels with the current time and userid:

<PRE>
      set label "generated on `date +%Y-%m-%d`by `whoami`" at 1,1
      set timestamp "generated on %Y-%m-%d by `whoami`"

The general rules of syntax and punctuation in `gnuplot` are that keywords
and options are order-dependent.  Options and any accompanying parameters are
separated by spaces whereas lists and coordinates are separated by commas.
Ranges are separated by colons and enclosed in brackets [], text and file
names are enclosed in quotes, and a few miscellaneous things are enclosed
in parentheses.  Braces {} are used for a few special purposes.


<P>
Commas are used to separate coordinates on the `set` commands section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC137">2.19.2 arrow</A>,
section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC170">2.19.28 key</A>, and section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC171">2.19.29 label</A>; the list of variables being fitted (the list after the
`via` keyword on the `fit` command); lists of discrete contours or the loop
parameters which specify them on the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC147">2.19.10 cntrparam</A> command; the arguments
of the `set` commands section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC156">2.19.16 dgrid3d</A>, section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC157">2.19.17 dummy</A>, section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC169">2.19.27 isosamples</A>, section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC186">2.19.43 offsets</A>, section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC187">2.19.44 origin</A>,

which specify them; the offsets for titles and axis labels; parametric
functions to be used to calculate the x, y, and z coordinates on the `plot`,
section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC131">2.15 replot</A> and `splot` commands; and the complete sets of keywords specifying
individual plots (data sets or functions) on the `plot`, section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC131">2.15 replot</A> and `splot`
commands.


<P>
Parentheses are used to delimit sets of explicit tics (as opposed to loop
parameters) and to indicate computations in the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC121">2.11.1.7 using</A> filter of the `fit`,
`plot`, section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC131">2.15 replot</A> and `splot` commands.


<P>
(Parentheses and commas are also used as usual in function notation.)


<P>
Brackets are used to delimit ranges, whether they are given on `set`, `plot`
or `splot` commands.


<P>
Colons are used to separate extrema in `range` specifications (whether they
are given on `set`, `plot` or `splot` commands) and to separate entries in
the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC121">2.11.1.7 using</A> filter of the `plot`, section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC131">2.15 replot</A>, `splot` and `fit` commands.


<P>
Semicolons are used to separate commands given on a single command line.


<P>
Braces are used in text to be specially processed by some terminals, like
section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC198">2.19.49.6 postscript</A>.  They are also used to denote complex numbers: {3,2} = 3 + 2i.


<P>
Text may be enclosed in single- or double-quotes.  Backslash processing of
sequences like \n (newline) and \345 (octal character code) is performed for
double-quoted strings, but not for single-quoted strings.


<P>
The justification is the same for each line of a multi-line string.  Thus the
center-justified string

<PRE>
      "This is the first line of text.\nThis is the second line."
</PRE>

<P>
will produce

<PRE>
                       This is the first line of text.
                          This is the second line.
</PRE>

<P>
but

<PRE>
      'This is the first line of text.\nThis is the second line.'
</PRE>

<P>
will produce

<PRE>
          This is the first line of text.\nThis is the second line.

</PRE>

<P>
Filenames may be entered with either single- or double-quotes.  In this
manual the command examples generally single-quote filenames and double-quote
other string tokens for clarity.


<P>
At present you should not embed \n inside {} when using the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC198">2.19.49.6 postscript</A>
terminal.


<P>
The EEPIC, Imagen, Uniplex, LaTeX, and TPIC drivers allow a newline to be
specified by \\ in a single-quoted string or \\\\ in a double-quoted string.


<P>
Back-quotes are used to enclose system commands for substitution.




<H2><A NAME="SEC90" HREF="gnuplot_toc.html#TOC90">1.17 Time/Date data</A></H2>

<P>
^ &#60;a name="Time/Date data"&#62;&#60;/a&#62;
^ &#60;a name="Time/date"&#62;&#60;/a&#62;
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>


<P>
`gnuplot` supports the use of time and/or date information as input data.
This feature is activated by the commands `set xdata time`, `set ydata time`,
etc.


<P>
Internally all times and dates are converted to the number of seconds from
the year 2000.  The command section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC303">2.19.64 timefmt</A> defines the format for all inputs:
data files, ranges, tics, label positions--in short, anything that accepts a
data value must receive it in this format.  Since only one input format can
be in force at a given time, all time/date quantities being input at the same
time must be presented in the same format.  Thus if both x and y data in a
file are time/date, they must be in the same format.


<P>
The conversion to and from seconds assumes Universal Time (which is the same
as Greenwich Standard Time).  There is no provision for changing the time
zone or for daylight savings.  If all your data refer to the same time zone
(and are all either daylight or standard) you don't need to worry about these
things.  But if the absolute time is crucial for your application, you'll
need to convert to UT yourself.


<P>
Commands like section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC323">2.19.84 xrange</A> will re-interpret the integer according to
section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC303">2.19.64 timefmt</A>.  If you change section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC303">2.19.64 timefmt</A>, and then `show` the quantity again, it
will be displayed in the new section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC303">2.19.64 timefmt</A>.  For that matter, if you give the
deactivation command (like section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC319">2.19.80 xdata</A>), the quantity will be shown in its
numerical form.


<P>
The command `set format` defines the format that will be used for tic labels,
whether or not the specified axis is time/date.


<P>
If time/date information is to be plotted from a file, the section <A HREF="gnuplot_2.html#SEC121">2.11.1.7 using</A> option
_must_ be used on the `plot` or `splot` command.  These commands simply use
white space to separate columns, but white space may be embedded within the
time/date string.  If you use tabs as a separator, some trial-and-error may
be necessary to discover how your system treats them.


<P>
The following example demonstrates time/date plotting.


<P>
Suppose the file "data" contains records like



<PRE>
      03/21/95 10:00  6.02e23

</PRE>

<P>
This file can be plotted by



<PRE>
      set xdata time
      set timefmt "%m/%d/%y"
      set xrange ["03/21/95":"03/22/95"]
      set format x "%m/%d"
      set timefmt "%m/%d/%y %H:%M"
      plot "data" using 1:3

</PRE>

<P>
which will produce xtic labels that look like "03/21".


<P>
See the descriptions of each command for more details.
