Scripts for converting AMBER input files to Blue Matter.

top2xml_amber[6|8].pl: 

        Topology converters, convert an AMBER prmtop file to XML which
	can then be fed to probspecgen, etc. to produce a .hpp file.

	usage:	top2xml_amber6.pl <prmtop> <xmlout> [water_name]
	usage:	top2xml_amber8.pl <prmtop> <xmlout> [water_name]

	[water_name] is optional and will be used to identify special residues
	for water-water interactions or constraint dynamics

        There are two versions of the converter, one for AMBER6-style ("old")
        prmtop format and the other for the newer AMBER8-style format.

ambercrd2dvs.pl: 

        coordinate file converter, converts a formatted AMBER prmcrd or mdrst file
	to a DVS file.  If there is no velocity information in the topology
	file, zero velocites are assumed. 

	usage:	ambercrd2dvs.pl <prmcrd> <dvsout>

        The <dvsout> file is a flat file of position & velocity triples & needs to be
        converted to binary format using dvsconv before use by BlueMatter.

	Keep in mind that since box information is not stored in the DVS file
	it will have to be added to the RTP file by hand.

Examples can be found in the example subdirectory.
