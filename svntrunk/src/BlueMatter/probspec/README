This README describes the two ways to generate problem descriptions from a CHARMM psf file. 
To build the requisite files, execute the 'build' script in the same directory as this README.
Warranty is void if the build script is not in the same directory as this README file.

PSF --> HPP
	------
	To gerenate a probspec header file from a CHARMM psf file use the following command:

		spec   <psf filename>   >   <hpp filename>

	This will give the default fragmentation scheme of one fragment per residue, using the
	CHARMM22 parameter set.


PSF --> XML
	------
	To generate the xml form of the problem specification:

		psf2xml	  <psf filename>    >    <xml filename>

	This writes the xml form of the system described in the psf file with the CHARMM22 
	parameter set.

EXAMPLES:

	---------------     generate the hpp for enkp
	cd $BLUEMATTERROOT/probspec
	build
	bin/spec data/enkp.psf | more


	---------------     generate the xml for enkp
	cd $BLUEMATTERROOT/probspec
	build
	bin/psf2xml data/enkp.psf | more
