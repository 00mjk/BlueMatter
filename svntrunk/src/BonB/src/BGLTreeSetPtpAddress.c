//      File: blade/spi/BGLTreeSetPtpAddress.c
//
//   Purpose: Implement Status Queries for Blade's Tree Network System Programming Interface.
//
//   Program: Bluegene/L Advanced Diagnostics Environment (BLADE)
//
//    Author: Matthias A. Blumrich (blumrich@us.ibm.com)
//
//     Notes: This SPI is intended for system software development,
//             and in many cases, simplicity has been eschewed for performance
//             and explicit control over the Tree.
//
//   History: 04/11/2003: MAB - Created.
