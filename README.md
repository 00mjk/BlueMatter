This is BlueMatter, the molecular dynamics application which was used to
exercise the BlueGene/L and BlueGene/P range of supercomputers. 
This code is written to the hardware interfaces on BlueGene/L and BlueGene/P, 
rather than to MPI; so it would require some rework to be usable on current 
supercomputers. 
Code not written by IBMers has been removed; you are recommended to visit 
http://fftw.org/ and http://numerical.recipes/ to find the missing code. 
BlueMatter is set up to build with a version of ODE, the OSF Development
Environment. You can find the appropriate version of ODE here
https://github.com/IBM/ode .
